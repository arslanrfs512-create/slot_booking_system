# 13) Important implementation notes & constraints I enforced

- All DB access uses PDO + prepared statements.
- Creating template + player_pricings + many time_slots uses a DB transaction in `templates_save.php`.
- Booking uses an atomic `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` then creates booking and updates slot status inside a transaction.
- Player pricing generation is only from parent template `min_players` → `max_players`.
- Time-slots are saved with `template_id` linking them to template.
- Admin can set refresh via `settings` table; public calendar reads `slot_refresh_interval_seconds` and auto-refresh uses that default (editable via DB).
- AJAX endpoints return JSON with `success` and `message`.
- UI labels show English + a short Urdu phrase (to satisfy bilingual requirement).
- Client-side jQuery covers:
  - generate date rows from date range
  - add/remove time-slot rows per date with staff select
  - generate player pricing rows from min/max
  - client-side required fields; server validates additionally
  - AJAX submit to endpoints
- Slot statuses: available, reserved, booked, blocked, cancelled. Colors included in calendar CSS classes.

# 14) What I did *not* implement (but suggested)

- Admin authentication/login (recommended for production).
- Payment gateway integration (left as placeholder).
- Full calendar UI (I provided a 7-day card grid; you can replace with FullCalendar if desired).
- Extensive CSS/UX polish (you can use Tailwind or design system to iterate).

# 15) Next steps / how I recommend you run it

1. Import `schema.sql` into your MySQL server.
2. Update `config.php` DB credentials.
3. Place files as shown and ensure PHP can write logs if any.
4. Browse to `/admin/index.php` to create a template + slots.
5. Visit `/public/calendar.php` to see slots and test booking.

If you want, I can:
- Package everything into a single downloadable zip (I cannot create files on your machine from here, but I can produce a tarball script you can run).
- Add admin authentication (simple username/password).
- Improve the public calendar UI to a month-view using FullCalendar (requires adding that library).
- Convert styling to Tailwind instead of Bootstrap.

Tell me which extra features you want and I’ll extend the code accordingly. -->
